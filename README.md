## Game Directions

#### Objective

Our hero snake is hungry! Help the hero snake find food by guiding them to the randomly dropping apples on the screen.

Be careful though, as our hero snake consumes more apples, the hero snake will grow longer with each bite! Do not run into yourself or run into the walls. Otherwise, it is game over!

#### Controls

* Up arrow: Move the snake up
* Left arrow: Move the snake left
* Down arrow: Move the snake down
* Right arrow: Move the snake right

## Feature List

As it currently exists, the MVP is a playable game with a definitive goal and end condition. To make the player's experience even more enjoyable, I would love to add some more features later including:

* Convert JavaScript syntax to ES6
* Implement high score
* Increase the snake speed every 10 points to increase the game's difficulty
* Full screen the game in the browser instead of the current "Nokia phone" experience
* Game changes colors or patterns as the player's score increases
* Design "game over" state with a clear restart button
* Display your score at the end of the game versus the current high score
